Description: Our site helps users to order healthy food. The user chooses his favorite establishment from there, then their specific product and pays. Each user has their own account, where they already have their own default address and username, and bind a card there. You can simply find your favorite food without a restaurant name. In the order section, you can indicate your preferences (allergies to any product).
